> A CLI development template powered by modern tooling, integrating TypeScript, tsup for builds, consola for logging, and other core components to accelerate high-quality CLI project setup.

## ‚ú® Features

* **CLI Toolchain:** Integrates `ts-node` (for direct TypeScript execution during development) and `tsup` (for production-grade builds), supporting the full workflow from debugging to deployment.
* **TypeScript Support:** Full TypeScript configuration (including `tsconfig.json`) with type checking and auto-completion to ensure code maintainability.
* **Structured Logging:** Implements leveled logging (info/warn/error), custom formatting, and context-aware messages via `consola` to enhance debugging efficiency.
* **Data Parsing:** Built-in `destr` for safe parsing of JSON-like data (e.g., CLI arguments, config files), preventing exceptions from `JSON.parse`.
* **Terminal Styling:** Uses lightweight `picocolors` for cross-platform terminal color support (160+ color codes) and styles (bold/underline) to improve CLI interactivity.
* **Code Quality:** Integrated ESLint (based on `@antfu/eslint-config`) for automated code style checks, error detection, and best practice enforcement.
* **Rapid Builds:** `tsup` default configuration supports ESM output, source maps, and type declaration generation, with 30%+ faster build times compared to traditional tools.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project running locally.

### Prerequisites

* Ensure you have the following installed:
    * Node.js (>= 18.x recommended)
    * Package manager (npm, yarn, or pnpm)
    ```bash
    node -v
    npm -v # or yarn -v or pnpm -v
    ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Trapar-waves/cli-template.git
    cd cli-template
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    # Use your preferred package manager
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### Available Scripts

Common scripts available via `npm run <script>`, `yarn <script>`, or `pnpm <script>`:

* `start`: Starts the CLI tool using `ts-node` for development purposes.
* `start:node`: Runs the CLI tool directly with Node.js, bypassing TypeScript compilation.
* `build`: Creates a production-ready build using `tsup`.
* `build:watch`: Watches for file changes and rebuilds the project automatically during development.

Example:
```bash
# Run the CLI tool in development mode
npm run start

# Build the project for production
npm run build
```

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Here's the basic workflow:

1. **Submit an Issue**: Describe the problem or suggestion in [Issues](https://github.com/Trapar-waves/cli-template/issues) (search for existing issues first).
2. **Create a Branch**: Check out a new branch from `main` (e.g., `feat/new-command` or `fix/log-bug`).
3. **Modify Code**: Ensure ESLint checks pass (`npm run lint`) and add tests if applicable.
4. **Submit a PR**: Create a Pull Request to `main` with a description of changes and motivations.

Note: Review the [Code Style Guide](https://github.com/antfu/eslint-config) (based on this project's ESLint setup) before contributing.
